# IrelandOverhaul

Hello there!

I assume you're here to install my mod. Well here's how you go about it.

Unless you've changed something, there should be a Hearts of Iron IV folder in 
C:\Users\[Your User Account Here]\Documents\Paradox Interactive\

Go inside the Hearts of Iron IV folder, and there should be a folder called "mod".

Drop the irelandoverhaul folder inside there, along with irelandoverhaul.mod.
(just to be clear, this is the irelandoverhaul folder all lower case. it's inside the IrelandOverhaul folder when you download and 
unzip the mod)

You should be done!

FAQ:

Q: I was playing your mod, then it crashed. I cleared my user directory and then your mod disappeared! What do I do?

A: Don't panic! Clearing the user directory backs up and clears certain folders in the Hearts of Iron IV folder in the documents.
   If you check in a Backup folder it created, all the files should be in there. Just move it back and you should be fine.
   
Q: This mod is extremely historically inaccurate.

A: That's not a question, but yeah I know. This mod was mostly created to make Ireland more fun to play, rather than create a mod 
   dedicated to historical accuracy. It was also created to help me get better at modding, so if you see some kinks here and there, 
   that's why.
